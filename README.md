# fundation-exploration
This repo is just an implimentation of the fundation site generator by @nonstopcoder

## What is in it?
I have dropped my personal website into this and started converting the structure of my page data into an object.

This way, I can explore how the MVC structure of fundation works.

I also created some test content and played around with less.

This is an ugly, lumpy old repo, but it's mine, and I like it.

##Why Manatees?

Manatees are the most under-rated of all sea mammals.

They are smart, gentle survivors.

They aren't cute like dolphins or murderous like killer whales.

They aren't giants like humpbacks, sperm whales, or blue whales.

They aren't pack animals like seals or sea lions.

Nope, just solitary old manatees, chomping on grass, with good long memories, excellent communication skills, and sterling personalities.
